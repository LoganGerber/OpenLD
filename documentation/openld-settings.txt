Possible settings:
* Language
* Theme
* Window layout
* Window size
* Login sessions
* Preview area quality
* Keybindings
* Font size
* Font family


Settings saved with the Show file:
* List of registered fixtures
* List of input devices
* Stage info (model for stage, fixtures, fixture layout, etc)
* Show's update rate (25 fps, 29fps, 30fps, etc)


Handling settings:
* Settings each have a known type
* Settings can have a condition to determine if they appear to the user
    - Need a Setting class that holds the type, value, and condition
* Plugins can add settings of their own
    - There needs to be a way to register settings


Example packages that might add settings:
* Virtual controllers
* Export to different formats
* Different timeline visualizations
* Adding different DMX fixtures


Settings:
* In a package, there might be extra settings that need to be defined.
* VSCode finds settings in the extention's package.json #/contribution/configuration path
    - This standard can be brought over to OpenLD as well.
